IOCipher: Encrypted Virtual Disk (for Android and Linux JVM)
------------------------------------------------------------

IOCipher is a virtual encrypted disk for apps without requiring the device to
be rooted. It uses a clone of the standard java.io API for working with
files. Just password handling & opening the virtual disk are what stand
between developers and fully encrypted file storage. It is based on libsqlfs
and SQLCipher.

If you are using this in your app, we'd love to hear about it!

The 2 Main Components
---------------------

[<b>libsqlfs</b>](https://github.com/zoff99/iocipher_pack/blob/master/002_src_libsqlfs/sqlfs.c) is a single source library that translates filesystem functions into SQL queries and vice versa.
<br><br>
<b>IOCipher</b> is a bunch of [JNI code](https://github.com/zoff99/iocipher_pack/tree/master/003_src_iocipher/libiocipher2-c/src/main/cpp) and [Java classes](https://github.com/zoff99/iocipher_pack/tree/master/003_src_iocipher/libiocipher2-c/src/main/java/info/guardianproject) to almost transparently emulate `java.io.*` classes with
`info.guardianproject.iocipher.*` classes of the same name.

Building for Android
--------------------

This app relies on OpenSSL libcrypto, sqlcipher, and libsqlfs, which
are all "native" C code that need to be built.

```
# you need docker and jdk 11 or higher installed
./compile_docker_all.sh
```

Usage in an Android App:

<br>

add to your project `build.gradle`<br>
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
}
```

add to your module `build.gradle`<br>
```
implementation 'com.github.zoff99:pkgs_guardianprojectIOCipher:1.0.11'
```

then see
https://github.com/zoff99/iocipher_pack/tree/master/007_example_android
for a usage example.

Building for Linux
------------------

Building for Windows (on Linux)
-------------------------------

This app relies on OpenSSL libcrypto, sqlcipher, and libsqlfs, which
are all "native" C code that need to be built.

```
# you need docker and jdk 11 or higher installed
./compile_docker_all.sh
cd ./003_src_iocipher/linux_jni/c_src
./compile_linux_c.sh

# you need a working x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc installed and in your path
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
          wine libwine-dev libwine wine64 wine64-tools \
          make wget git coreutils autoconf \

License
-------

When taken as a whole, this project is under the the LGPLv3 license
since it is the only license that is compatible with the licenses of
all the components.  The source code for this comes from a few
different places, so there are a number of licenses for different
chunks.

* Apache 2.0 (Android Internals): Much of the code here is taken from
  the Android internals, so it has an Apache 2.0 license.

* OpenSSL has an Apache 2.0 license.

* LGPL 2.1 (libsqlfs)

* BSD-style (sqlcipher)

We believe the LGPLv3 is compatible with all reasonable uses, including
proprietary software, but let us know if it provides difficulties for you.

Current bugs
------------

There are still some "int" values used for sizes.
mtime and atime is not fully working the same as posix files.
